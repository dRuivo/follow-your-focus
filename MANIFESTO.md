# Manifesto

## Technical tools should serve people, not extract value from them.

I believe that professional filmmaking equipment should be:

- **Accessible** — not locked behind paywalls or proprietary ecosystems
- **Repairable** — designed to last, adapt, and improve over time
- **Shareable** — knowledge and designs belong to the community
- **Local** — fabricated where you are, by people you know
- **Trustworthy** — no accounts, no subscriptions, no tracking

### Why I built this

Professional gear is often overpriced, proprietary, or designed to be discarded. Follow Your Focus exists as an alternative: generate your own equipment, adapt it to what you actually need, and share what you learn.

### How it's done

- All computation happens in your browser
- Your data never leaves your device
- The code is open source and free forever
- You own what you make

### Who this is for

- Filmmakers tired of vendor lock-in
- Makers and repair cafés
- Communities building their own tools
- Anyone who believes tools should be regenerative

### My commitment

I will never sell your data. There will be no paywall.

This is a commons project, built for the commons.

If this serves you, share it. Improve it. Make it your own.
