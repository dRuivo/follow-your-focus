# Follow Focus Ring Generator

Community-built tool for regenerative filmmaking

**Welcome to the commons.**

This is a free, browser-based tool for generating parametric follow focus rings for cameras and lenses.
It is designed for filmmakers, makers, repair cafés, fab labs, and anyone who believes tools should be shared, adaptable, and owned by the community.

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Built:** 2026  
**Status:** Free forever

## Why this exists

This project was created out of a simple conviction:

> Technical tools should serve people, not extract value from them.

Professional filmmaking accessories are often overpriced, locked behind proprietary systems, or designed to be replaced rather than repaired. This tool offers an alternative: generate your own follow focus rings, adapt them to your lenses, and fabricate them locally.

No accounts.  
No subscriptions.  
No telemetry.  
No platform lock-in.
